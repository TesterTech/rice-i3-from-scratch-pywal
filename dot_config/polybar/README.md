# Polybar 
- Polybar can be launched by calling `launch.sh` argument is the theme
- There are two themes currently hack and vallen both are quite different
- The thing they do have in common is they have a topbar and a bottom bar. 
- Systray is bottom right. 

```$ cat ~/scripts/polybarstart 
#!/bin/bash

$HOME/.config/polybar/launch.sh --vallen
```
